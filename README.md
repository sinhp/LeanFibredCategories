# Lean4 Formalization Of The Theory Of Fibred Categories

In this project I formalized the theory of Grothendieck fibration. I proved in Lean that the Grothendieck construction of a `Cat`-valed functor is an example of a Grothendieck fibration. The other famous cases of domain and codomain fibrations are also formalized. Discrete fibrations are another important example of Grothendieck fibrations which is formalized in this project.
